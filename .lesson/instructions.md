# Instructions  

You have a group of friends coming to visit for your high school reunion, and you want to take them out to eat at a local restaurant. You aren’t sure if any of them have dietary restrictions, but your restaurant choices are as follows:


Downshift Diner – Vegetarian: No, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
Bellacinos – Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: Yes
Blue Spoon Café – Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes
Portabella – Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
The Railyard – Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes


Write a program that asks whether any members of your party are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, and then displays only the restaurants that you may take the group to. Examples of program output can be found to the left as "OutputExamples".
